# Artist Images

## Required Images

### Pardyalone
- **File:** `pardyalone.jpg` or `pardyalone.webp`
- **Location:** `/public/images/artists/`
- **Recommended Size:** 800x800px minimum
- **Format:** WebP preferred, JPG acceptable
- **Usage:** Artist profile page, featured artists section

## Adding New Artist Images

1. Place artist images in this directory: `/public/images/artists/`
2. Use WebP format for best performance
3. Optimize images before uploading (use tools like TinyPNG or Squoosh)
4. Naming convention: `artist-slug.webp` (e.g., `pardyalone.webp`, `alki.webp`)
5. Update the artist data in `/src/data/mockData.ts` with the correct path

## Current Artist Images

- ✅ Alki: `/images/team/alki.webp` (currently in team directory)
- ❌ Pardyalone: `/images/artists/pardyalone.jpg` (NEEDS TO BE ADDED)

## TODO

- [ ] Add Pardyalone artist photo
- [ ] Consider moving Alki image to artists directory for consistency
- [ ] Add tour promotional images
- [ ] Add venue/backyard example photos
